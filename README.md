# crfa-dapp-store-service

## Requirements
- JDK17

## TODO
- scrolls: volume fixes 
- scrolls: to which pool is a given smart contract delegated? (needed for details page)
- scrolls: total fees genereted by script address, dapp release and of course dapp root level
- scrolls: avg transaction size per script addr
- scrolls: avg transaction fee per script addr
- 
- consider using bloom filters instead of HashSet (memory optimisation only)
- 
- scrolls: user contract transactions vs all contract transactions

REALLY EASY since we already have a reducer for it:
- dashboard: general number of smart contract transactions on epoch level at the top of the homepage
